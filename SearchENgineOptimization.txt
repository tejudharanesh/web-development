1. Title Tag
    Title tags, designated by H1, are arguably the most crucial HTML tags for SEO.
    They serve as concise, keyword-rich headlines that summarize a webpage’s content. 
    Search engines rely on title tags to grasp a page’s topic and relevance. 
    To boost your SEO, ensure your title tags incorporate relevant keywords effectively.

2. Header Tags – H1, H2 & H3
    Header tags, encompassing H2, H3, and H4, serve a vital role in content organization 
    and SEO. Search engines use header tags to comprehend the hierarchy of content. 
    Including relevant keywords in header tags enhances the readability of your content 
    and signals its structure.

    Example HTML code for header tags:

        <h1>Most Important</h1>
        <h2>Second Most Important</h2>
        <h3>Third Most Important</h3>


3. Bold & Strong
    The <b> tag is used to apply bold formatting to the enclosed text without implying any 
    specific importance or significance. It is mainly a presentational element for making 
    text visually bold.

    The <strong> tag is used to indicate that the enclosed text should be given strong 
    emphasis. It carries semantic meaning and implies that the text is of greater importance 
    than the surrounding content. While it also makes text bold, its primary purpose is to 
    convey significance to search engines and assistive technologies.

        HTML code for bold & strong tags:

            <b>keyword</b>
            <strong>keyword</strong>


4. Image & alt text
    Image alt tags are essential for optimizing images on your website. 
    They provide alternative text descriptions for images, ensuring that your content 
    remains accessible to visually impaired users and search engines. 
    Incorporating descriptive and keyword-rich alt tags for images is a fundamental SEO practice.

        HTML code for an image with an alt tag:

            <img src=”keyword.jpg” alt=”keyword” />


5. Hyperlink
    A hyperlink, often referred to as a “link,” is an element that allows users to 
    navigate from one web page to another or to different sections within the same 
    page by clicking on a text, image, or other content. Hyperlinks are created using 
    the <a> (anchor) element and include the destination URL in the href attribute. 
    They are fundamental for connecting web pages and providing seamless navigation 
    on the World Wide Web

        <a href=”http://www.website.com/page.html” title=”keyword”>keyword</a>


6. Hyperlink (Nofollow link)
    In HTML, a hyperlink with the rel="nofollow" attribute is a link that tells 
    search engines not to follow the link or consider it when ranking the linked page. 
    This attribute is commonly used when you want to provide a link to another website 
    but do not want to pass on SEO “link juice” or authority to that site. 
    It is often used for user-generated content, comments, or links to potentially 
    low-quality or untrusted websites.

        <a href=”http://www.website.com/page.html” title=”keyword” rel=”nofollow” >keyword</a>


7. Canonical
    Canonical tags are crucial for resolving duplicate content issues. 
    They specify the preferred version of a page when multiple URLs display 
    similar content. Properly implemented canonical tags guide search engines 
    to index and rank the right page, averting SEO complications.

        HTML code for a canonical tag:

            <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/page" />


8. Hreflang
    Hreflang tags are important only to websites with international audiences. 
    These tags convey to search engines which language and region-specific versions 
    of a page to display to users in different locales. Implementing hreflang tags 
    effectively enhances your content’s visibility worldwide.

        HTML code for a hreflang tag:

        <link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-us" href="https://www.example.com/en-us/page" />
        <link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr-fr" href="https://www.example.com/fr-fr/page" />


9. Meta Description
    Meta description tags are the brief snippets that appear beneath the title 
    in search engine results. While they don’t influence rankings directly, 
    compelling meta descriptions can significantly impact click-through rates. 
    Crafting concise and engaging meta descriptions is essential, 
    as they offer users a glimpse of your page’s content.

        HTML code for a meta description tag:

        <meta name="description" content="Learn how to create effective title tags for better SEO results." />


10. Robots Meta tags
    Robot meta tags are instructions for search engine crawlers on how to interact 
    with your web pages. They can control indexing, follow or nofollow links, 
    and affect how cached pages are displayed. Correctly configuring robot meta 
    tags aligns your content with your SEO strategy.

         HTML code for robot meta tags:

        <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
